Sure! Here's a step-by-step procedure for creating your interactive maximum sum descent game:

1. Set up your development environment:
   - Install the necessary software and tools for game development, such as a programming language (e.g., Python), a game development framework (e.g., Pygame), and an integrated development environment (IDE) or code editor.
   - Ensure you have the required libraries and dependencies installed for your chosen development framework.

2. Design the game screen:
   - Decide on the dimensions and layout of the game screen. Consider using a fixed-size window or fullscreen mode, depending on your preference.
   - Create a visually appealing background for the game screen.
   - Allocate areas on the screen for displaying the triangle, buttons, and messages.

3. Implement the game logic:
   - Define the logic for generating the triangles of heights 3, 5, and 7. You can create functions or classes to generate the triangles based on the specified heights.
   - Implement the maximum sum descent algorithm described in the problem statement using dynamic programming. Write functions to calculate the maximum sum for each cell in the triangle.
   - Create a function to compare the user's selected path against the maximum sum and determine whether they win or lose.

4. Handle user interactions:
   - Set up event handling to detect mouse clicks and movements on the game screen.
   - Implement functions to determine which triangle cell the user has clicked based on their mouse position.
   - Keep track of the user's selected path and update the display accordingly.

5. Display the game elements:
   - Render the generated triangle on the game screen, displaying the numbers in an appropriate format.
   - Create buttons or other interactive elements to allow the user to select the level and start the game.
   - Display messages to indicate the game's state, such as winning or losing.

6. Implement game flow and transitions:
   - Create functions to manage the game's flow, such as starting a new game, transitioning between levels, and displaying the solution when the user loses.
   - Handle input from the user to control the game flow, such as clicking on level selection buttons or restarting the game.

7. Polish and test the game:
   - Add visual effects, animations, and sound effects to enhance the user experience.
   - Test the game thoroughly, including different scenarios and edge cases, to ensure it functions as expected.
   - Make any necessary adjustments or bug fixes based on testing results.

8. Deploy and share the game:
   - Package the game for distribution, depending on your chosen development framework. This may involve creating an executable file or creating an installer package.
   - Share your game with others, whether by uploading it to a website, sharing the installer, or distributing it through other means.

Remember to break down the implementation into smaller tasks and tackle them one by one. This procedure provides a high-level overview, and you can dive into each step with more detail based on your chosen programming language and game development framework. Good luck with your game development!

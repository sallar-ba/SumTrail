Introduction
Sum Trail is an immersive desktop game that challenges players' problem-solving skills with its unique gameplay mechanics. Based on the concept of the maximum sum descent problem, the game presents players with a thrilling puzzle experience. With visually stunning graphics, interactive gameplay, and multiple levels of difficulty, Sum Trail offers an engaging and intellectually stimulating adventure for players of all ages.

Objective
In Sum Trail, the main objective is to navigate through a triangular grid and select a path that maximizes the sum of numbers along the way. By strategically choosing the right sequence of numbers, players can aim to achieve the highest possible sum. The game employs dynamic programming techniques to calculate the optimal sum, providing players with a benchmark to test their puzzle-solving skills.

Gameplay
Sum Trail offers three levels of difficulty, each featuring a different triangular grid with heights of 3, 5, and 7. Players can choose their desired level using intuitive mouse controls, allowing for a customized gameplay experience. Once a level is selected, the corresponding triangular grid is generated, and the adventure begins.
Using the mouse, players can click on the numbers in the grid to create a path. The game follows the rules of the maximum sum descent problem, allowing players to select adjacent numbers according to specific criteria. As players progress, the selected path is highlighted, providing visual feedback and aiding strategy development.
At the base of each level's triangular grid, Sum Trail evaluates the sum achieved by the player's chosen path. The game compares this sum to the optimal sum obtained through dynamic programming. If the player's sum matches the optimal sum, they emerge victorious. Otherwise, they will need to analyze the solution and identify the deviations from the optimal path.
